#### 2.4.4 Acoustic Notification System

**Purpose and Criticality:**
The acoustic notification system serves to immediately draw attention to critical and exceptional system events. Since traders often monitor multiple screens or temporarily step away from the system, acoustic signals are essential for timely reaction to important events.

**Critical Event Categories:**

**Highest Priority (Immediate Reaction Required):**

- **Stop-Loss Reached:** Clear, persistent warning signal when stop-loss levels are reached.
- **System Emergency Stop:** Critical alarm on manual or automatic emergency shutdown of the trading system.
- **Exchange Connection Loss:** Immediate alarm on loss of API connection to primary exchanges.
- **Critical System Error:** Alarm signal for serious errors that endanger trading operations.

**High Priority (Prompt Attention Desired):**

- **Take-Profit Reached:** Positive signal tone on successful profit-taking.
- **Large Position Opened:** Notification when configured position sizes are exceeded.
- **AI Model Switch:** Acoustic confirmation on automatic or manual AI model switch.
- **Risk Management Intervention:** Warning signal on automatic risk management interventions.

**Medium Priority (Informational Notifications):**

- **Trading Session Start/End:** Confirmation tone at the beginning or end of trading sessions.
- **Backup System Activation:** Notification on failover to backup systems.
- **Unusual Market Movements:** Attention signal for exceptional volatility.

**Audio Signal Specifications:**

**Technical Requirements:**

- **PyQt6 QSound Integration:** Native PyQt6 audio output for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Audio File Formats:** WAV format for low latency and high compatibility.
- **Volume Control:** User-configurable volume per event category (0-100%).

**Signal Design Principles:**

- **Clear Differentiation:** Each event category has characteristic audio signatures.
- **Non-distracting:** Signals are noticeable but not disruptive to concentrated work.
- **Culturally Neutral:** Audio signals avoid culture-specific associations.
- **Frequency-optimized:** Audio frequencies optimized for human attention (500-4000 Hz).

**Example Audio Signal Assignments:**

- **Stop-Loss:** Three short, high-pitched beeps (1000 Hz, 0.3s interval, 3x repetition).
- **Emergency Stop:** Continuous alarm tone (800 Hz, 2s duration) with a 1s pause, endless until confirmation.
- **Connection Loss:** Two deep warning tones (600 Hz, 0.5s duration, 1s pause, 2x repetition).
- **Take-Profit:** Single positive chime (ascending triad 440-554-659 Hz).
- **AI Model Switch:** Short confirmation tone (750 Hz, 0.2s duration).

**User Configuration:**

**Audio Settings Interface:**

- **Master Audio Enable/Disable:** Global activation/deactivation of all acoustic notifications.
- **Category-specific Controls:** Individual on/off switches for each event category.
- **Volume Sliders:** Separate volume control for each priority level.
- **Time Window Configuration:** "Silent hours" for automatic audio deactivation.
- **Test Functions:** Audio preview for all configured signals.

**Advanced Options:**

- **Custom Audio Files:** Import user-defined WAV files for specific events.
- **Audio Repetition Logic:** Configurable repetition for critical events until user confirmation.
- **Volume Ramping:** Gentle volume increase for critical events for increased attention.
- **Multi-Device Support:** Audio output to multiple devices for redundancy.

**Integration into GUI Components:**

**Visual-Audio Synchronization:**

- **Combined Alerts:** Acoustic signals are always accompanied by visual notifications.
- **Status Indicators:** GUI shows current audio settings and active notifications.
- **Alert History:** Log of all issued acoustic notifications with timestamps.
- **User Acknowledgment:** Explicit confirmation option for critical alarms to terminate the signal.

**Performance Requirements:**

- **Audio Latency:** < 50ms from event trigger to audio output.
- **Resource Overhead:** < 1% CPU usage for the audio subsystem.
- **Concurrent Audio:** Simultaneous audio output for multiple events without interference.
- **Failsafe Mechanism:** Alternative notification methods in case of audio system failure.

#### 3.1.4 Configuration Management System

The system implements a comprehensive, flexible configuration management system based on YAML files with environment-based overriding:

**Configuration Hierarchy:**

**1. config.default.yaml (Master Template):**

```yaml
# Project Chimera Default Configuration Template
application:
  name: "Project Chimera"
  version: "1.0.0"
  environment: "development"
  debug_mode: true

trading:
  default_leverage: 3
  max_portfolio_risk: 0.25
  risk_management_mode: "conservative"  # conservative, dynamic, user_controlled
  stop_loss_percentage: 0.02
  take_profit_percentage: 0.05
  max_daily_trades: 50

ai_models:
  active_model: "hybrid_v1"
  model_switching_enabled: true
  confidence_threshold: 0.75
  feature_update_interval: 300  # seconds
  backtesting_enabled: true

data_sources:
  phemex:
    api_url: "https://api.phemex.com"
    websocket_url: "wss://phemex.com/ws"
    rate_limit: 10  # requests per second
  binance:
    api_url: "https://api.binance.com/api/v3"
    websocket_url: "wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws"
    rate_limit: 5
  
database:
  engine: "sqlite3"
  file_path: "./data/database/chimera.db"
  backup_path: "./data/backups/"
  auto_backup: true
  backup_interval: 3600  # seconds

cache:
  in_memory: true
  max_size: 1000  # MB
  ttl: 3600  # seconds

notifications:
  acoustic:
    enabled: true
    volume: 0.7
    emergency_sound: "emergency.wav"
  discord:
    enabled: false
    webhook_url: ""
  email:
    enabled: false
    smtp_server: ""
    smtp_port: 587
    username: ""

gui:
  theme: "dark"  # light, dark, auto
  window_size: [1920, 1080]
  refresh_rate: 1000  # milliseconds
  tooltips_enabled: true

security:
  api_key_encryption: true
  session_timeout: 3600  # seconds
  max_login_attempts: 5
```

**2. config.local.yaml (Development Override):**

```yaml
# Local Development Configuration Override
application:
  debug_mode: true
  environment: "local"

trading:
  # Use Phemex Testnet for development
  use_testnet: true
  max_portfolio_risk: 0.10  # Reduced risk for testing

database:
  timescale:
    host: "localhost"
    database: "chimera_dev"

notifications:
  acoustic:
    volume: 0.3  # Reduced volume for development
  discord:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: "${DISCORD_WEBHOOK_DEV}"

security:
  session_timeout: 7200  # Extended timeout for development
```

**3. Secure Credentials Management System (Production):**

**Security Problem with Environment Variables:**
Environment variables are a significant security risk because they are:
- Stored in plain text in memory.
- Visible in process lists (`ps aux`, Task Manager).
- Can be recorded in log files and crash dumps.
- Can remain in shell history after service restarts.

**Secure Alternative - Encrypted Credentials File:**

```yaml
# config/production.yaml (NO sensitive data!)
application:
  name: "Project Chimera"
  environment: "production"
  debug_mode: false

# Paths to encrypted credential stores
credentials:
  encrypted_store_path: "/secure/credentials.enc"
  backup_store_path: "/secure/backup/credentials_backup.enc"
  master_key_file: "/secure/.master.key"  # Hardware-protected key file

# Only non-sensitive Infrastructure-Settings
database:
  timescale:
    host: "timescale-prod.internal"
    port: 5432
    database: "chimera_prod"
    # Credentials are loaded from encrypted store

trading:
  exchanges:
    phemex:
      api_url: "https://api.phemex.com"
      testnet: false
      # API keys are loaded from encrypted store

notifications:
  discord:
    enabled: true
    # Webhook URLs are loaded from encrypted store
  email:
    smtp_host: "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port: 587
    # Email credentials are loaded from encrypted store

security:
  session_timeout: 3600
  max_login_attempts: 3
  audit_logging: true
```

**Encrypted Credentials File Structure:**

```python
# Example for secure credential storage implementation
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC

            fernet = Fernet(key)
            decrypted_data = fernet.decrypt(encrypted_data)
            self._credentials = json.loads(decrypted_data.decode())

            master_password = None
            key = None

        # Implementation for HSM, Smart Card, or TPM
        # For Development: File-based master key
        if os.path.exists(self.master_key_file):
            with open(self.master_key_file, 'rb') as f:

net localgroup "Log on as a service" ChimeraService /add

:: 4. Install Python service
cd /d "%~dp0"
python -m pip install pywin32
python service_manager.py install

:: 5. Start service
sc start ChimeraTrading
```

**Configuration Loader System:**

```python
# Example Configuration Loading Logic
import os
import yaml
from typing import Dict, Any

class ConfigurationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = self._load_configuration()
    
    def _load_configuration(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # 1. Load default configuration
        with open('config/config.default.yaml', 'r') as f:
            config = yaml.safe_load(f)
        
        # 2. Override with local configuration if exists
        local_config_path = 'config/config.local.yaml'
        if os.path.exists(local_config_path):
            with open(local_config_path, 'r') as f:
                local_config = yaml.safe_load(f)
                config = self._deep_merge(config, local_config)
        
        # 3. Override with environment variables
        config = self._apply_env_overrides(config)
        
        return config
    
    def _apply_env_overrides(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Apply environment variable overrides using dot notation"""
        env_mapping = {
            'CHIMERA_DB_HOST': 'database.timescale.host',
            'CHIMERA_DB_PASSWORD': 'database.timescale.password',
            'CHIMERA_PHEMEX_API_KEY': 'trading.phemex.api_key',
            'CHIMERA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK': 'notifications.discord.webhook_url',
            # ... other mappings
        }
        
        for env_var, config_path in env_mapping.items():
            env_value = os.getenv(env_var)
            if env_value:
                self._set_nested_value(config, config_path, env_value)
        
        return config
```

python -m venv venv

# Activate Environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Database Setup

```cmd
# SQLite3 database is created automatically
python scripts/setup_database.py

# Create directories

mkdir data\backups 2>nul
```

## Start Backend

```cmd
# Activate Virtual Environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Set Environment Variables
set CHIMERA_ENV=development
set PYTHONPATH=.\src

# Start Backend (central main file)
python src\backend\main.py
```

## Start Frontend

```cmd
# New Terminal Window
# Activate Virtual Environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Set Environment Variables  
set CHIMERA_ENV=development
set PYTHONPATH=.\src

# Start Frontend (central main file)
python src\frontend\main.py
```

## Development Mode

```cmd
# For development: Auto-Reload enabled
# Backend with Uvicorn Reload
uvicorn src.backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend with Debug Mode
python src\frontend\main.py --debug
```

## Validation

After starting, the following services should be accessible:

- Backend API: <http://localhost:8000>
- Frontend GUI: Desktop application starts automatically
- Database: SQLite3 file in ./data/chimera.db

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

1. Check Python version: `python --version`
2. Virtual Environment activated: Prompt should show `(venv)`
3. All dependencies installed: `pip list`

**Update requirements for START_GUIDE.md:**

- Must be updated with every change to the start sequence.
- All commands must be optimized for Windows cmd/PowerShell.
- No references to shell scripts - only direct Python calls via main.py.
- Complete path specifications for the Windows environment.

#### 4.4.2 STATUS.md - Implementation Tracking

**Purpose and Structure:**

The STATUS.md file serves as a central overview of the implementation status of all main components of Project Chimera. It must be updated with every significant development activity and is maintained as a separate file in the project root.

**Component Status Visualization:**

The STATUS.md file must contain a Mermaid diagram that groups logical areas as subgraphs and visualizes the status of each component through direct color assignment.

**Example Structure for STATUS.md:**

```markdown

test('Button Design Patterns', async ({ page }) => {
  // Primary Button Specifications
  const primaryButton = page.locator('.btn-primary');
  await expect(primaryButton).toHaveCSS('background-color', DESIGN_TOKENS.colors.primary);
  await expect(primaryButton).toHaveCSS('border-radius', DESIGN_TOKENS.borderRadius.standard);
  await expect(primaryButton).toHaveCSS('padding', DESIGN_TOKENS.spacing.buttonPadding);
  
  // Model Selection Button Tests
  const lstmButton = page.locator('[data-testid="model-lstm"]');
  await expect(lstmButton).toHaveCSS('background-color', DESIGN_TOKENS.colors.modelLSTM);
  await expect(lstmButton).toContainText('LSTM');
  
  // Animation Duration Tests
  await expect(primaryButton).toHaveCSS('transition-duration', DESIGN_TOKENS.animation.hoverDuration);
});

test('Widget Layout Patterns', async ({ page }) => {
  // Dashboard Grid Tests
  const dashboard = page.locator('.dashboard-grid');
  await expect(dashboard).toHaveCSS('grid-template-columns', DESIGN_TOKENS.layout.gridColumns);
  await expect(dashboard).toHaveCSS('gap', DESIGN_TOKENS.spacing.gridGutter);
  
  // Widget Spacing Tests
  const widgets = page.locator('.dashboard-widget');
  for (let i = 0; i < await widgets.count(); i++) {
    await expect(widgets.nth(i)).toHaveCSS('margin-bottom', DESIGN_TOKENS.spacing.widgetMargin);
    await expect(widgets.nth(i)).toHaveCSS('border-radius', DESIGN_TOKENS.borderRadius.widget);
  }
});

test('CSS-File Compliance', async ({ page }) => {
  // Verify no inline styles exist in Python-generated elements
  const allElements = page.locator('*[style]');
  await expect(allElements).toHaveCount(0); // No inline styles allowed
  
  // Verify external CSS is loaded
  const cssLinks = page.locator('link[rel="stylesheet"]');
  await expect(cssLinks).toHaveCount(6); // base, components, layout, animations, theme, responsive
  
  // Test CSS variable usage instead of hard-coded values
  const primaryButton = page.locator('.btn-primary');
  const computedBg = await primaryButton.evaluate(el => 
    getComputedStyle(el).getPropertyValue('background-color')
  );
  expect(computedBg).not.toMatch(/rgb\(\d+,\s*\d+,\s*\d+\)/); // Should use CSS variables
});
```

**Maintenance Process:**

- **Update Cycles:** DESIGN_PATTERN.md must be updated with every UI component change.
- **Review Process:** All design changes require design review before code implementation.
- **Compliance Tests:** Playwright tests must be extended with every design pattern change.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automatic validation via Git workflow & CI/CD pipeline (see section 4.5).
- **Versioning:** Design pattern changes are tracked via Git commits.
- **Stakeholder Approval:** Major design changes require UX team approval.

**Mermaid Best Practices for Project Chimera:**

- **Consistent Class Names:** Use uniform CSS classes for status indication.
- **Readable Labels:** Short, concise labels for better clarity.
- **Logical Grouping:** Use subgraphs for related components.
- **Color Coding:** Uniform colors for status (Green=Done, Yellow=In Progress, Red=Not Started).
- **Dependency Direction:** Arrows show logical dependencies or data flow.
- **Maintenance:** Diagrams must be updated accordingly with changes.

## 5. Granular Implementation Phase Plan

**Strategic Development Approach:**
This plan defines the logical sequence of development through high-level phases, where each core element is treated as a self-contained, independent task set. Each phase represents the **what-level** of implementation - what is to be developed - not the **how-level** of detailed development tasks.

### 5.1 Phase Plan Architecture

**Basic Principles:**

- **One Core Element per Phase:** Each phase focuses on exactly one main component of the system.
- **Completed Task Sets:** Each phase represents a complete, testable system component.
- **Logical Dependency Order:** Phases build on each other and respect technical dependencies.
- **What-Focus:** Definition of the components to be developed, not the implementation details.

### 5.2 Phase Categorization

| Layer | Phases | Duration | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Foundation Layer** | 1-10 | 21 weeks | Basic system infrastructure & security |
| **AI Core Layer** | 11-16 | 18 weeks | Artificial intelligence and machine learning |
| **Trading Layer** | 17-25 | 18 weeks | Trading engine and strategy management |
| **User Interface Layer** | 26-33 | 16 weeks | User interface and visualization |
| **Security Layer** | 34-36 | 7 weeks | Advanced Security & Recovery Implementation |
| **Integration Layer** | 37 | 3 weeks | System integration and production readiness |

**Total Development Time:** 83 weeks

### 5.3 Core Element Phase Plan (37 Phases - Extended for complete Core Element Coverage)

**Why 37 Phases?** Each phase corresponds to a specific core element of the architecture. This expansion ensures the complete implementation of all main components defined in the functional specification and system architecture, including the extended Credentials Management System.

This phase plan strictly follows the **"One Phase per Core Element"** rule.

#### Phase Overview (Table)

Create a high-level table that summarizes all the phases detailed below. This table serves as a "master plan" and for quick orientation.
